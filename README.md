# Lafia Detector

This is an Android application that detects the defects of tomatoes using a deep learning model and computer vision. The model is based on transfer learning with YOLOv8 and has been trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## Download

The application can be downloaded from the following link:

## Features

- Detects the defects of tomatoes in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a defect score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consists of 2452 images with 2 classes. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:

## Model Training

The model was trained using transfer learning with YOLOv8 on a custom dataset from Roboflow. Once trained, the custom YOLOv8 model was converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on Android.

<br>Batch: In machine learning, data is often divided into smaller subsets called batches to manage memory usage and speed up the training process. "train_batch0" usually refers to the first batch of training data.<br>
Contents of the Batch: Typically, "train_batch0" will contain a set of images or data examples that have been sampled from the training dataset. For example, if you're training an image recognition model, this batch might consist of several images selected from the dataset.<br>
Visualization: The "train_batch0" image may display the examples contained in this batch, often arranged in a grid or some other format. This visualization helps in verifying that the images are correctly loaded and representative of the training data.<br>
Additional Information: The image might also include additional details such as image labels (if applicable), batch size, or other relevant information useful for analyzing the batch.</p>
