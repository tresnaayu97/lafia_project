# Lafia Detector

This is an Android application that detects the defects of tomatoes using a deep learning model and computer vision. The model is based on transfer learning with YOLOv8 and has been trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## Download

The application can be downloaded from the following link:

[Download Lafia Detector APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XTaKibZQVaXQsfYLlI8x4MWIeA6F8Spf/view?usp=sharing)

## Features

- Detects the defects of tomatoes in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a defect score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consists of 2452 images with 2 classes. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:

## Model Training

The model was trained using transfer learning with YOLOv8 on a custom dataset from Roboflow. Once trained, the custom YOLOv8 model was converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on Android.

<br>"train_batch0" typically refers to the first batch of training data in the context of machine learning or deep learning.<br>
    1. Training Batch: In machine learning, training data is often divided into smaller subsets called batches. These batches are used to feed data into the model in portions rather than all at once, which helps in managing memory usage and can make the training process more efficient.<br>
    2. First Batch (Batch 0): The term "train_batch0" indicates that it is the very first batch of data used during the training phase of a model. The numbering usually starts at 0, following the convention in programming where counting starts from zero.<br>
    3. Training Process: During training, the model iteratively processes each batch, updates its parameters (weights), and aims to minimize the loss function. The first batch, or "train_batch0," initiates this process.<br>
    4. Composition: A batch typically contains a set number of samples (e.g., images, text snippets, data points) along with their corresponding labels (in supervised learning scenarios).</p>

<br>"train_batch1" refers to the second batch of training data used in the training phase of a machine learning or deep learning model. Numbering typically starts at 0, so "train_batch1" is the batch that follows "train_batch0". It contains a subset of the training data, which is processed by the model to update its parameters and improve performance.</p>
