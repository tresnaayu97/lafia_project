# Lafia Detector

This is an Android application that detects the defects of tomatoes using a deep learning model and computer vision. The model is based on transfer learning with YOLOv8 and has been trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## Download

The application can be downloaded from the following link:

[Download Lafia Detector APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XTaKibZQVaXQsfYLlI8x4MWIeA6F8Spf/view?usp=sharing)

## Features

- Detects the defects of tomatoes in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a defect score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consists of 2452 images with 2 classes. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:

## Model Training

The model was trained using transfer learning with YOLOv8 on a custom dataset from Roboflow. Once trained, the custom YOLOv8 model was converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on Android.

## Result
<p>
    <img src="home.jpg" >
<br>"train_batch0" refers to the first batch of training data used in the training phase of a machine learning or deep learning model. It contains the initial subset of the training data, which the model processes to begin updating its parameters and improving performance.</p>
